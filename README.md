# Sales-Prediction
We have the sales data for 45 different wallmart stores and we are trying to predict the weekly sales of different stores based on variables such as store number, date, temperature, fuel price, unemployment rate etc.
We have used all the different regression machine learning techniques and used the best model along with its hyperparameter tuning for the prediction.
A demo for deployment by taking user-input is also shown in the end of the project for future prediction using the model
